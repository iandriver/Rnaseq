fix bit with aligner as a command-line param....



The -h flag should also show the list of available commands.

The way you're handling the aligner issue sucks.  Would it be better
to subclass Step so as to allow steps to have their own logic?  Steps 
would presumably be loaded similarly to the way commands currently are.  
Attributes like 'args' and various suffixes could be set via object 
attributes.

Want to put back in the bit that makes certain object keys (eg step['exe']) into attributes; 
could do this in dict_like: if class defines list of attributes to set. (Note: dict_like already
does something like that...)


Allow key=value params on command line to set any templated value? (store them in RnaseqGlobals, probably)


Create more rnaseq/prov commands to query db:
- list all pipelines
- list all pipeline stats (steps, 
- list pipeline run stats (status, success, step times)
- list/run partial pipelines (start step, end step)

- job control


add (optional) labels to pipeline_runs; tie in to working_dir?; not quite

make sure correct reference genomes are being used for organism of data.
